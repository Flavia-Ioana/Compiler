Project description: The project involved designing a programming language using YACC/BISON in C++, including syntax for types, arrays, classes, and control statements. It featured a symbol table for scope management, semantic analysis for type consistency, and evaluation of expressions using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).

Technologies: YACC/BISON (for grammar and parsing), C++ (for language implementation), Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) (for expression evaluation), Symbol Tables (for managing variable and function scopes).
