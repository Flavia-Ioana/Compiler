# Compiler
 
Project description: Designed and implemented an original programming language using YACC/BISON in C++. The project involved creating syntax for predefined types, arrays, classes, variable and function declarations, control statements, and assignment expressions. Developed a symbol table system supporting various scopes and performed semantic analysis to ensure type consistency and correct usage of variables and functions. Implemented evaluation of arithmetic and boolean expressions using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).

Technologies: YACC/BISON (for grammar and parsing), C++ (for language implementation), Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) (for expression evaluation), Symbol Tables (for managing variable and function scopes).
